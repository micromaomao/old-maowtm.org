        | <b>I'm a programmer</b>. I write code throughout my childhood. Sometimes I
        | consider myself a "<i>expert</i>" on programming, but often I end up finding
        | out that I'm way far from "<i>expert</i>". <b>I love open source and free culture</b>
        | and share almost everything I created. I've wrote a lot of code, however most of
        | them end up being taken down by me from GitHub 1 or 2 years later because I think
        | those code were poorly written. I still keep them as archive on a disk
        | placed in my drawer.

        | <b>I'm emotionally strange</b>. Not only did I often feel shamed by my old Facebook ( or Wechat )
        | posts because I used to be extermly emotional and sometimes took things too seriously,
        | also I often unreasonably feel bad just because my friends ignore or reject me and
        | it's kind of hard for me to reject others also.
    p
        | <b>I'm technically strange.</b> I like to make use of <i>technologies</i> like fancy cryptography
        | and end up getting things overcomplicated. ( I still think we should all go https though. )
        | Also I often brings unnecessary <i>logic</i> to life and end up doing weird things.
        | I often try to summarize things happen in real life into determined rules or theories.
